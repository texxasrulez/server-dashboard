# Extra Theme Pack (14 themes)
Drop everything into `assets/css/themes/`. Each theme has a desktop CSS and a mobile CSS with hardened guards.

Themes:
- cobalt, glacier (light), nebula, slate, twilight, nightowl
- azure (light), royal, tealwave, storm, cloud (light)
- cyber (fun), sunrise (light warm), graphite

Notes:
- These are tokens-only; no selectors or layout changes.
- Mobile files do not change tokens; they only apply the mobile/desktop guard so your header never doubles again.
- Switch in the theme picker; the names equal the filenames.
